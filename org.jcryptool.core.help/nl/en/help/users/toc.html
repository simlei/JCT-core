	<h1>User Guide</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool (JCT) is a free and open-source cryptographic e-learning software with many visualizations.</p>
    <p>It is based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> Rich Client Platform (RCP). You will recognize a lot of concepts
	in case you ever worked with Eclipse or an Eclipse RCP.</p>

	<p>Beginner or not, the <strong>User Guide</strong> will introduce you in the many possibilities you have with JCrypTool. The following pages therefore contain information about the different <a href="general/editors.html">Editors</a>, <a href="general/views.html">Views</a> and <a href="general/perspectives.html">Perspectives</a>. And of course the crypto plug-ins, starting from <a href="algorithms/toc.html">Algorithms</a>, <a href="analysis/toc.html">Cryptanalysis</a>, <a href="games/toc.html">Games</a>, and last but not least <a href="visualizations/toc.html">Visualizations</a>.</p>

    <p>The content of the <strong>User Guide</strong> (online help) is delivered by the developers of the crypto plug-ins. This means that one plug-in contains more help, the other one less. The JCT core team tries to ensure a minimum and consistent quality over all plug-ins and their according online help. In case you do have any question about a certain plug-in or need more assistance it is best to contact the plug-in developer directly. In case you do not know the developer or you cannot reach him, feel free to post a message in the <a href="https://gitter.im/dschadow/jcryptool">JCrypTool Developer Chat</a>.</p>

    <p>The online help for the JCrypTool core is fully available in German and English.</p>
