	<h1>About JCrypTool (JCT)</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool is an extendable e-learning platform presenting cryptography, cryptanalysis, and IT Security in a
	modern and easy-to-use fashion.</p>
    <p>JCrypTool is built as platform-independent open-source software and is part of the open-source project <a href="http://www.cryptool.org/">CrypTool</a>.</p>
    <p>A tabular overview about all functions in all CrypTool programs including JCT can be found at the CrypTool website in the <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/en/ctp-documentation/functionvolume">function overview</a>.</p>
	<p>JCT is developed since 2009. More than 100 people contributed. After many beta versions and 9 milestone versions, the release 1.0 was published in February 2020. JCT contains more than 200 cryptologic functions, many of them as visualizations. We learned a lot about remote and agile programming, and about the hurdles of the Java infrastructure. However, we hope, that the contributors nevertheless had fun and learned also a lot about cryptology. And most important, we hope the users will have fun learning and experiencing cryptography and cryptanalysis.</p>
