This project is a hot-fix replacing the org.eclipse.help.ui binaries to fix ReusableHelpPart not disposing itself.
To not have to ship the whole entourage of org.eclipse.help.ui (I actually failed to build it with maven in the first place), 
this replaces the version with the one that the other target platform plugins expect.
