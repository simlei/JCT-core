    <h1>Console</h1>

    <p>The JCrypTool <strong>Console</strong> enables you to directly enter commands inside JCrypTool. To start the view either click
    the console icon in the toolbar or use the usual way via the <strong>Window -&gt; Show view</strong> dialog.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The console is by default shown at the bottom of the JCrypTool window. You can directly start typing commands, just like in the
	Windows command prompt or a terminal on Linux or macOSX.</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>

	<p>The whole console is text oriented and only offers a minimal toolbar. The only action available here is to delete the views content.
	All other commands have to be entered manually.</p>

	<p>Use the command <strong>help</strong> for general assistance. Without any other parameter you get an overview about all available
	commands. This includes algorithms. The amount of available commands depends on the installed plug-ins in your environment (plug-ins
	can provide their own extensions to the Console view).</p>

	<p>A more detailed description for one of the available commands can be shown by entering <strong>help commandname</strong>, e.g.
	<strong>help caesar</strong>. This shows you the syntax of all available parameters/ options of the command. The commands and their
	possible parameters/ options do differ between the crypto plug-ins. Some commands may not be available everywhere, or they result into
	different operations. So simply use the command help via <strong>help commandname</strong> to get all this information.</p>

	<h2>Command Overview</h2>

	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Command</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>help <em>[Command]</em></td>
				<td>Without any following command or parameter (entering <strong>help</strong> only) all available commands will be listed
				(including the algorithms).	With another command or parameter (e.g. <strong>help caesar</strong>) the syntax of the given
				command with its parameters and options will be	shown.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<h2>Limitations</h2>

	<p>Not every crypto plug-in can be used via the console. Only algorithm plug-ins (from classic to modern) in principal do support
	the console. Analysis, Games and Visualizations are not supported. In order for an algorithm to be used via the console, the plug-in
	must provide certain extensions. This requires the plug-in developer to extend a so called <a href="dev.html">Extension Point</a> with
	his plug-in. However this extension is optional, so even if a crypto plug-in is available in the menu or the
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/view_algorithms.html">Crypto Explorer</a> view it is not necessarily
	available in the Console view too.</p>
